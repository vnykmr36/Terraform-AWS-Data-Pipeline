# Terraform to deploy multiple AWS resources

Within this code package, we launch a multitude of services where an entire data pipeline is laid after we provision required infrastructure.

List of services launched:

- VPC
- IAM
- EC2
- RDS
- S3
- DMS

Data pipeline to set full data and change data replication on to a S3 data lake where downstream can be used for analysis.
